    *filename* is a path to a pickle file that will store the cache
    between runs.

    If *save_every* is set to None, the cache will only be saved at exit
    (or when wrapper.cache_save is explicitly callde). If it's a number N,
    the cache will be saved every N cache misses.

    If *maxsize* is set to None, the LRU features are disabled and the cache
    can grow without bound.

    If *typed* is True, arguments of different types will be cached separately.
    For example, f(3.0) and f(3) will be treated as distinct calls with
    distinct results.

    Arguments to the cached function must be hashable.

    View the cache statistics named tuple (hits, misses, maxsize, currsize)
    with f.cache_info().  Clear the cache and statistics with f.cache_clear().
    Access the underlying function with f.__wrapped__.
